<h2> 1. learning:</h2>
<p>This course covers JavaScript as it exists today. It assumes basic familiarity with JavaScript:

You should know how to define a function and write an if.
You should have seen the this keyword before, but you don't need to know about its confusing quirks (there are many of them).
You should know common array operations, like map and filter. If you need to learn about these, we teach them in our Javascript Arrays course!
Variable scoping has often been a sore point in JavaScript. The simplest assignment syntax, x = 1, defines a global variable. That's rarely what we want!

Fortunately, modern versions of JavaScript have "strict mode". It prevents many kinds of mistakes, including global variable definitions like x = 1. Strict mode is enabled by putting the string 'use strict' at the top of a module or function.</p>

<h2> 2. let</h2>
<p>Add a value of x that makes this code produce the result shown at the bottom. We'll always run all of the code together from top to bottom: both the code that you can't change and the code that you wrote.

function double(aNumber) {
  return 2 * aNumber;
}
3
const x = 3
double(x);
